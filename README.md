This repository contains capstone project of Google Data Analytics course - Case Study 1: Cyclistic Bike-Sharing

## About the company

In 2016, Cyclistic launched a successful bike-share offering. Since then, the program has grown to a fleet of 5,824 bicycles that are
geotracked and locked into a network of 692

## Scenario

You are a junior data analyst working in the marketing analyst team at Cyclistic, a bike-share company in Chicago. The director of marketing believes the companyâ€™s future success depends on maximizing the number of annual memberships. Therefore, your team wants to understand how casual riders and annual members use Cyclistic bikes differently. From these insights, your team will design a new marketing strategy to convert casual riders into annual members. But first, Cyclistic executives must approve your recommendations, so they must be backed up with compelling data insights and professional data visualizations.

Cyclistic categorize it users into two categories:

*  casual : Customer who purchase single ride or full-day passes.
*  members: Customer who purchase annual membership.

## Business Question

Three questions will guide the future marketing program:

* How do annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently?
* Why would casual riders buy Cyclistic annual memberships?
* How can Cyclistic use digital media to influence casual riders to become members?

## Dataset

For this project, I use 6-months Cyclistic riding data from January to June 2023. 

## Tools

I'm using R to load, clean, transform, analyze and visualize the data.
